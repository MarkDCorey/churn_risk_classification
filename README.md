# churn_risk_classification
creating a classifier from a sample ride-share service data set 

This is a stab at creating a churn prediction classifier. I'm using a sample data set of 50K records from a ride sharing service. Predicting users that have a high churn risk enables the business to bucket these users separately for special promotional incentives, allocation of client service resources, etc to drive reengagement and prevent churn.
